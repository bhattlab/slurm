## Setup

### Deploy profile

To deploy this profile, run

	mkdir -p ~/.config/snakemake
	cd ~/.config/snakemake
	cookiecutter https://github.com/bhattlab/slurm.git

Then, you can run Snakemake with

	snakemake --profile scg ...


### Resources

The following resources are supported by on a per-rule basis:

- **mem**: set the memory resource request in mb.
- **walltime**, **runtime**: set the time resource in min.
- **ntasks**: set the number of cpus


## Tests

Test-driven development is enabled through the tests folder. Provided
that the user has installed docker and enabled [docker
swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), the SLURM tests will
download two images:

1. [quay.io/biocontainers/snakemake](https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/snakemake?tab=tags)
2. [giovtorres/docker-centos7-slurm](https://github.com/giovtorres/docker-centos7-slurm)

In addition, testing of the cookiecutter template itself is enabled
through the [pytest plugin for
Cookiecutters](https://github.com/hackebrot/pytest-cookies). You can
run the tests by issuing

	pytest -v -s
